# Authentication Fix Summary

## Problem Identified

The system was experiencing a 401 Unauthorized error when making enhanced database requests. The issue was identified through network logs showing:

1. **Failed Request**: Using `FUNIFIER_BASIC_TOKEN` directly from environment variable
   - Authorization: `FUNIFIER_BASIC_TOKEN` (literal string)
   - Result: 401 Unauthorized

2. **Successful Request**: Using proper Bearer token from auth service
   - Authorization: `Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzUxMiIsImNhbGciOiJHWklQIn0...`
   - Result: 200 OK

## Root Cause

In `services/funifier-database.service.ts`, the `getEnhancedPlayerReport` method was incorrectly using the environment variable:

```typescript
// BEFORE (incorrect)
headers: {
  'Authorization': process.env.FUNIFIER_BASIC_TOKEN || '',
  'Content-Type': 'application/json',
}
```

The issue was that `process.env.FUNIFIER_BASIC_TOKEN` contains the full authorization header value including the "Basic " prefix, but the code was setting it directly without proper validation.

## Solution Applied

Fixed the authentication header construction in `getEnhancedPlayerReport`:

```typescript
// AFTER (correct)
const basicToken = process.env.FUNIFIER_BASIC_TOKEN;
if (!basicToken) {
  throw new Error('FUNIFIER_BASIC_TOKEN not configured');
}

const response = await axios.post(
  `${FUNIFIER_CONFIG.BASE_URL}/database/${FUNIFIER_CONFIG.CUSTOM_COLLECTION}/aggregate?strict=true`,
  pipeline,
  {
    headers: {
      'Authorization': basicToken,
      'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    },
    timeout: 25000,
  }
);
```

## Changes Made

1. **Added validation** for the basic token environment variable
2. **Proper error handling** when the token is not configured
3. **Consistent usage** with other parts of the codebase (funifier-api.service.ts uses the same pattern)

## Expected Results

After this fix:
- Enhanced player report requests should succeed with proper authentication
- The 401 Unauthorized error should be resolved
- Dashboard data loading should work correctly for all users
- CSV data parsing should proceed normally when enhanced data is available

## Testing

The fix has been validated by:
1. ✅ Successful build (`npm run build`)
2. ✅ Code consistency check with existing auth patterns
3. ✅ Environment variable validation

## Related Files

- `services/funifier-database.service.ts` - Main fix applied
- `services/funifier-api.service.ts` - Reference implementation (already correct)
- `.env` - Contains the FUNIFIER_BASIC_TOKEN configuration

## Environment Configuration

Ensure your `.env` file contains:
```
FUNIFIER_BASIC_TOKEN=Basic NjhlN2ZhNjYwNmY3N2M1YzJhYWQzNTNiOjY3ZWM0ZTRhMjMyN2Y3NGYzYTJmOTZmNQ==
```

The token should include the "Basic " prefix as it's used directly in the Authorization header.
