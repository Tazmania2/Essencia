# Configuration Form Fixes

## âœ… **Issues Fixed:**

### **Problem 1: Form not fetching current data for each team**
- **Issue**: Form was only initialized once and didn't update when switching teams
- **Fix**: Added `useEffect` to reset form data when `teamType` or `currentConfig` changes
- **Result**: Form now loads the correct data for each selected team

### **Problem 2: Form state dragging changes between teams**
- **Issue**: When editing Carteira II and switching to Carteira IV, the changes would persist
- **Fix**: Added `key={selectedTeam}` prop to force complete component re-render when team changes
- **Result**: Form completely resets when switching teams, no state leakage

### **Additional Improvements:**

1. **Safety Checks**: Added null-safe operators (`?.`) to prevent crashes if data is missing
2. **Loading State**: Added loading indicator when form data is not available
3. **Visual Indicator**: Added "Editando: {teamType}" to clearly show which team is being edited
4. **Debug Logging**: Added console.log to track configuration loading for debugging

### **Code Changes:**

```typescript
// 1. Added key prop to force re-render
<ConfigurationForm
  key={selectedTeam} // Force re-render when team changes
  teamType={selectedTeam}
  currentConfig={currentConfig}
  onSave={handleSaveConfiguration}
  isLoading={loadingState.isLoading}
/>

// 2. Added useEffect to reset form data
useEffect(() => {
  const teamConfig = currentConfig.configurations[teamType];
  if (teamConfig) {
    console.log(`Loading configuration for ${teamType}:`, teamConfig);
    setFormData(teamConfig);
  }
}, [teamType, currentConfig]);

// 3. Added safety checks to inputs
value={formData.primaryGoal?.displayName || ''}
```

## âœ… **Expected Behavior Now:**

1. **Team Selection**: When you click on a different team (e.g., Carteira II â†’ Carteira IV):
   - Form completely resets
   - Loads the correct configuration for the selected team
   - Shows the team name in "Editando: {teamType}"

2. **Data Loading**: 
   - If team has custom configuration in database â†’ loads custom data
   - If team has no custom configuration â†’ loads default data for that team
   - Form fields populate with the correct values for each team

3. **State Isolation**: 
   - Changes made to one team don't affect other teams
   - Each team maintains its own configuration state
   - No cross-contamination between team configurations

## ðŸ§ª **Testing:**

To verify the fixes work:

1. Go to `/admin/configuration`
2. Select "Carteira II"
3. Make changes to the form fields
4. Switch to "Carteira IV"
5. Verify that:
   - Form shows Carteira IV's data (not Carteira II's changes)
   - "Editando: CARTEIRA_IV" is displayed
   - Form fields have the correct default/saved values for Carteira IV

The form should now properly isolate each team's configuration and load the correct data for each selected team.
