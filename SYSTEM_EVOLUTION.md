```typescript
// Before (incorrect)
headers: {
  'Authorization': process.env.FUNIFIER_BASIC_TOKEN || '',
}

// After (correct)
const basicToken = process.env.FUNIFIER_BASIC_TOKEN;
if (!basicToken) {
  throw new Error('FUNIFIER_BASIC_TOKEN not configured');
}
headers: {
  'Authorization': basicToken,
}
```
