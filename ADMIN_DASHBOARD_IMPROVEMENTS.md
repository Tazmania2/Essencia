### API Endpoints Used

```typescript
// Player Management
GET /v3/player                    // List all players
GET /v3/player/:id               // Get specific player
GET /v3/player/:id/status        // Get player status
GET /v3/player/status            // Get all players status
POST /v3/player                  // Create player
DELETE /v3/player/:id            // Delete player
POST /v3/player/:id/image        // Update player image

// Team Management
GET /v3/team                     // List all teams
GET /v3/team/:id                 // Get specific team
GET /v3/team/:id/member          // Get team members
POST /v3/team/:id/member/add/:playerId    // Add player to team
POST /v3/team/:id/member/remove/:playerId // Remove player from team
```

## üîÑ 2. Cycle Change System

### Features Implemented

#### ‚úÖ Automated Scheduler Execution
The system executes 4 schedulers in the correct order:

1. **68e7f93a06f77c5c2aad34f1** - Ciclo de transi√ß√£o de pontos Desbloqueados para Carteira de pontos da Temporada
2. **68e7f8be06f77c5c2aad34d5** - Ciclo de perda de pontos bloqueados ao fim do ciclo
3. **68de22de06f77c5c2aa9d2b6** - Resetar action_log em Troca de Ciclo
4. **68e803cf06f77c5c2aad37bc** - Limpar itens - fim de ciclo

#### ‚úÖ Comprehensive Validation System
After each scheduler execution, the system validates:

- **Step 1**: All players have cleared "points" (not locked_points or lost_points)
- **Step 2**: All players have cleared "locked_points"
- **Step 3**: All players have cleared challenge progress
- **Step 4**: All players have only the required virtual goods item (E6F0MJ3 - Bloqueado = 1)

#### ‚úÖ Real-time Progress Tracking
- **Live Updates**: Real-time progress updates during execution
- **Step-by-step Monitoring**: Visual progress indicators for each step
- **Execution Logs**: Detailed logs for each scheduler execution
- **Validation Results**: Clear success/failure indicators with detailed messages

#### ‚úÖ User Interface (`/admin/cycle-change`)
- **Process Control**: Initialize, start, cancel, and reset functionality
- **Progress Visualization**: Progress bars and status indicators
- **Step Details**: Expandable step information with execution times
- **Log Viewer**: Modal to view detailed scheduler logs
- **Safety Warnings**: Clear warnings about the process impact

### Scheduler API Endpoints Used

```typescript
// Scheduler Management
GET /v3/scheduler                    // List all schedulers
GET /v3/scheduler/:id               // Get specific scheduler
POST /v3/scheduler/execute/:id      // Execute scheduler
GET /v3/scheduler/log               // Get scheduler logs
```
